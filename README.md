This project demonstrates how to use an ESP8266 microcontroller to read data from an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) and send it to a local server using the HTTP REST API (POST method). 
The local server is implemented using Python's Flask framework, which receives the sensor data and responds accordingly.
